/**
 * File based micro php caching system.
 * 
 * This script will help you quickly enable 
 * filebased caching system on the project without any dependencies.
 * This is useful for that application which do not use big server and need to use caching system.
 * I have used this script for my amazon micro instance and it boosts up my speed by 400% so I plan to share it on 
 * github.
 * 
 * This caching system can be used on any framework.
 * 
 * Example:
 *  1.  Rename your project index file from index.php to index_project.php
 *  2.  Provide $project_index_file='index_project.php';
 *  3.  Create cache dir where your project index file and give 777 rights.
 * 
 *  Cheers n Enjoy Caching micro System
